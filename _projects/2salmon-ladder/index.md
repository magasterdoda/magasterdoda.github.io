title: Pull-Up Bar and Salmon Ladder
description:  Designed and fabricated a high-impact salmon ladder and pull-up bar structure for
    repetitive athletic use, emphasizing safety, durability, and real-world performance. Applied
    structural analysis, hand calculations, SOLIDWORKS modeling with FEA, and physical testing to
    validate the design under static and dynamic loading conditions.

skills: 
  - Mechanical Design
  - Structural Analysis & Hand Calculations
  - SOLIDWORKS
  - Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
  - Anisotropic material modeling
  - Woodworking fabrication

## Technical Approach
### Design, Analysis, and Fabrication
- Researched relevant impact testing standards and translated sponsor needs into clear engineering requirements
- Generated and evaluated multiple design concepts as a team, converging on a final system architecture
- Performed hand calculations to size structural components and estimate maximum deliverable impact force
- Created detailed SOLIDWORKS CAD models and validated designs using finite element analysis (FEA)
- Fabricated the test rig using manual machining (lathe and mill) and additive manufacturing (3D printing)

## Results
### Validated Performance and Experimental Findings
- Spring 2024 Texas A&M Engineering Project Showcase – OGRE Skin Test Rig (3rd place overall)
- Delivered an impact test rig capable of applying and measuring impacts up to 1,640 lbf with ±4% accuracy and 1 ms time resolution
- Generated experimental data demonstrating up to 30% reduction in peak impact force when using OGRE Skin
- Results were supported by 1,000 fps high-speed video, enabling detailed impact event analysis
