title: Pull-Up Bar and Salmon Ladder
description:  Designed and fabricated a high-impact salmon ladder and pull-up bar structure for
    repetitive athletic use, emphasizing safety, durability, and real-world performance. Applied
    structural analysis, hand calculations, SOLIDWORKS modeling with FEA, and physical testing to
    validate the design under static and dynamic loading conditions.

## Technical Approach
### Design, Analysis, and Fabrication
- Defined functional, safety, and durability requirements based on static bodyweight loads, dynamic pull-up forces, and impact loading from repeated bar drops
- Developed conservative load cases and targeted a safety factor of 5 to account for user variability and dynamic amplification
- Performed hand calculations to size structural members, joints, and fasteners for bending and shear stresses
- Created detailed SOLIDWORKS CAD models of the full assembly, including joints and load paths
- Validated the design using finite element analysis (FEA), incorporating anisotropic material properties for wood
- Fabricated and assembled the structure using standard woodworking tools and construction methods
