## Technical Approach
### Design, Analysis, and Fabrication
- Collaborated in a three-person team to design and analyze a novel scissor lift architecture from first principles
- Developed and evaluated load cases, performing hand calculations on critical members to estimate maximum stress and deflection
- Modeled the complete scissor lift assembly in SOLIDWORKS, including linkages, lead-screw actuation, and platform interfaces
- Conducted a design optimization study, introducing strategic cutouts and lightweight 3D-printed components to minimize mass while maintaining stiffness
- Produced detailed engineering drawings to support fabrication and assembly
- Manufactured and assembled the lift using provided raw materials, standard fasteners, and additive manufacturing

## Results
### Validated Performance and Experimental Findings
- Met all functional requirements and design constraints, including 50 mm closed height, 200 mm extended height, 6 × 8 in footprint, 20 lb load capacity, and weight minimization
- Achieved a final assembled mass of 791 g while supporting a 20 lb load at full extension with only 16 mm of deflection
- Demonstrated high structural efficiency, achieving the 2nd best load-to-weight ratio among all tested teams
