title: OGRE Skin Impact Test Rig
description:  Designed, prototyped and fabricated mechanical test rig for evaluating force impacts in collaboration with
    six-member capstone team. Applied robust mechanical design principles, prototyping techniques and tools such as SolidWorks
    to engineer a rig capable of delivering controlled impacts up to 2000 N and measured force responses across various protective
    materials. Conducted requirement analysis, iterative testing, and performance analysis to meet sponsor specifications within
    a $5000 budget and tight timeline. Presented technical rationale, design evolution and final results to project sponsor and
    faculty judges.

## Technical Approach
### Design, Analysis, and Fabrication
{% include image-gallery.html images="ogre-lathe.png, ogre-mill.jpg, ogre-build.jpg" height="250" %}  
- Researched relevant impact testing standards and translated sponsor needs into clear engineering requirements
- Generated and evaluated multiple design concepts as a team, converging on a final system architecture
- Performed hand calculations to size structural components and estimate maximum deliverable impact force
- Created detailed SOLIDWORKS CAD models and validated designs using finite element analysis (FEA)
- Fabricated the test rig using manual machining (lathe and mill) and additive manufacturing (3D printing)

## Results
### Validated Performance and Experimental Findings
{% include image-gallery.html images="ogre-winner.JPG, ogre-rig3.jpg" height="400" %}  
- Spring 2024 Texas A&M Engineering Project Showcase – OGRE Skin Test Rig (3rd place overall)
- Delivered an impact test rig capable of applying and measuring impacts up to 1,640 lbf with ±4% accuracy and 1 ms time resolution
- Generated experimental data demonstrating up to 30% reduction in peak impact force when using OGRE Skin
- Results were supported by 1,000 fps high-speed video, enabling detailed impact event analysis
