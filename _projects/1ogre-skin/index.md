title: OGRE Skin Impact Test Rig
description:  Designed, prototyped and fabricated mechanical test rig for evaluating force impacts in collaboration with
    six-member capstone team. Applied robust mechanical design principles, prototyping techniques and tools such as SolidWorks
    to engineer a rig capable of delivering controlled impacts up to 2000 N and measured force responses across various protective
    materials. Conducted requirement analysis, iterative testing, and performance analysis to meet sponsor specifications within
    a $5000 budget and tight timeline. Presented technical rationale, design evolution and final results to project sponsor and
    faculty judges.

## Technical Approach
### Design, Analysis, and Fabrication
- Defined functional, safety, and durability requirements based on static bodyweight loads, dynamic pull-up forces, and impact loading from repeated bar drops
- Developed conservative load cases and targeted a safety factor of 5 to account for user variability and dynamic amplification
- Performed hand calculations to size structural members, joints, and fasteners for bending, shear, and bearing stresses
- Created detailed SOLIDWORKS CAD models of the full assembly, including joints and load paths
- Validated the design using finite element analysis (FEA), incorporating anisotropic material properties for wood to better capture real structural behavior
- Iterated the design to balance strength, stiffness, material efficiency, and ease of fabrication
- Fabricated and assembled the structure using standard woodworking tools and construction methods

## Results
### Validated Performance and Experimental Findings
- Delivered a fully functional, outdoor-capable salmon ladder and pull-up bar structure designed for repeated high-impact athletic use
- Verified analytical and FEA predictions through real-world load and impact testing
- Demonstrated stable performance under repeated dynamic loading with no observed structural damage or excessive deflection
- Achieved a robust, safe design suitable for long-term use with minimal maintenance
