title: OGRE Skin Impact Test Rig
description:  Designed, prototyped and fabricated mechanical test rig for evaluating force impacts in collaboration with
    six-member capstone team. Applied robust mechanical design principles, prototyping techniques and tools such as SolidWorks
    to engineer a rig capable of delivering controlled impacts up to 2000 N and measured force responses across various protective
    materials. Conducted requirement analysis, iterative testing, and performance analysis to meet sponsor specifications within
    a $5000 budget and tight timeline. Presented technical rationale, design evolution and final results to project sponsor and
    faculty judges.
