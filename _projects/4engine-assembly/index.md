title: Engine Piston-Crankshaft Assembly
description:  Designed and analyzed a piston–connecting rod–crankshaft–flywheel assembly for
    a 6-cylinder, 4-stroke, 3000 cc inline engine capable of delivering at least 200 hp at up to 8,000 RPM.

skills: 
  - SOLIDWORKS
  - Finite Element Analysis (FEA) (Static, Dynamic, and Thermal)
  - Stress, deflection, fatigue, and fracture mechanics
  - Structural Analysis & Hand Calculations

## Technical Approach
### Design, Analysis, and Fabrication
- Performed a full four-stroke thermodynamic cycle analysis for each cylinder, explicitly stating and justifying modeling assumptions to determine peak pressures and temperatures
- Developed and compared two distinct piston–connecting rod–crankshaft–flywheel configurations, evaluating tradeoffs in mass, manufacturability, stress levels, and service life
- Created detailed free-body diagrams for all major rotating and reciprocating components across multiple crank angles
- Built a parametric Excel-based force and inertia model to compute internal forces, reactions, and moments as functions of crank position and engine speed
- Evaluated static and dynamic loading conditions, including inertia forces at high RPM, to identify worst-case stress and deflection locations
- Applied design-for-reliability principles, accounting for fatigue loading in high-cycle rotating components
- Incorporated cost, weight, safety, and maintainability considerations into configuration selection and optimization decisions

## Results
### Validated Performance and Experimental Findings
- Identified critical stress, deflection, and fatigue locations across all major components, informing configuration selection and final geometry refinement
- Selected an optimized configuration that balanced performance, weight, manufacturability, and predicted service life
- Demonstrated sufficient flywheel inertia to maintain engine operation through compression strokes while minimizing rotational mass
- Produced a complete, simulation-validated rotating assembly suitable for high-speed operation up to 8,000 RPM
- Delivered a professional, end-to-end design package supported by thermodynamic, structural, fatigue, and fracture analyses
